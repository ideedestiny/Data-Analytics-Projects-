# Data-Analytics-Projects

This repository is documents my data analysis/analytics personal projects. It demonstrates my proficiency in Python and its libraries(pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow), SQL and Powerbi. 
As a data scientists, I organize, clean, uncover patterns, meaningful insights and use appropriate models to make predictions. 


Part 1- SQL-report

The datasets used in this project were gotten from Entrylevel Data Analyst program.
